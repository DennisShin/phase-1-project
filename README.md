# Caring Companions

## Phase 1 Project

This simple website allows users to view a catalog of dogs and cats that are available for adoption.

Currently:
 - Users can click through to different sections using the navbar
 - Users can double click the logo in navbar to trigger dark mode
 - Users can add their own animals to the database
 - Users can look through dummy testimonials

Want To:

- Add a profile system so users can sign in and be unique
- Add a contact button so users can communicate with each other
- Make website look prettier
- Allow users to upload testimonials of their own
